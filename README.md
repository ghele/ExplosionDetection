# ExplosionDetectionApplication

The project is a web application implemented using the popular Python framework, called Flask. The developed software has the purpose of detecting the approximate area of an explosion that might happen in Cluj county (Romania), using an array of 30 sound detection sensors. 

### Installation

The project can be started from the command prompt or using an IDE, after installing some necessary Python libraries: *Flask*, *eventlet*, *socketio* and *zmq*. The dependencies can be installed using *pip*:

```sh
$ pip install <package_name>
```

The Python *microframework* offers a flexible environment for both the back end and front end development. The needed JavaScript libraries are loaded locally, so the user will get them once the project is downloaded. They also can accessed from a public CDN. The necessary libraries are: *socketio*, *jQuery*, *jQueryUI*, *Moment.JS* and a nice notification functionality was used that can be found [here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/23/notification-styles-inspiration/).

Then, the application can be started:

```sh
$ python project.py
```
